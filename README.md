# CECS---574---Privacy-preservation-in-distributed-machine-learning-or-deep-learning
This repository aims to distill key insights from a research paper exploring Distributed or Collaborative Deep Learning, where multiple participants contribute to model training from varied datasets while addressing significant privacy concerns. We categorize this paradigm into direct, indirect, and peer-to-peer approaches, examining associated privacy issues. Surveying cryptographic algorithms and techniques for privacy preservation, particularly focusing on Homomorphic Encryption, our repository highlights fundamental theories and suggests future directions, emphasizing the importance of mitigating privacy concerns in collaborative deep learning.

# Introduction:
Within the context of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) domains, this repository emphasizes the challenge of limited access to labeled datasets, especially in sensitive sectors like healthcare. We introduce Collaborative or Distributed Deep Learning as a potential solution, leveraging multiple data sources to refine model accuracy. However, we stress the critical necessity of privacy preservation, particularly in domains dealing with sensitive data. Critiquing existing survey papers for their generic approach and limited focus on privacy preservation, we highlight our unique contribution: categorizing collaborative deep learning into direct, indirect, and peer-to-peer approaches. We explore associated privacy concerns, review privacy preservation techniques, and underscore the significance of Homomorphic Encryption. Finally, we outline the repository's structure and contributions, including analyses of weight update theories and comparisons of privacy preservation approaches.
